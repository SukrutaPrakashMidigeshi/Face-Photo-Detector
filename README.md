This program is coded in python using the OpenCV library and can be executed successfully using any of the common editors available including pycharm using which the code was written. All the files that are required are also given in the repository. This, however, is a primitive program and has not been completed yet. The idea of the software is to detect human figures including photos, real human pictures and statues and convey the information in real life. The idea of the project is to first detect faces, if any and then locate the eyes present in the image. Once the eyes are detected, the software figures out if the subject is exhibiting blinking motion. It then categories the detected face accordingly. Although the concept seems logically accurate, when applied in a real world scenario, it seems to encounter many challenges. Due to the inefficiency of any of the camera systems, the program seems to be capturing noise or shaking motion of a photograph as blinking. This along with multiple other minor issues is taking the program a significant amount of time to optimise and print the correct output. However, with the introduction of facial motion detection and other optimization techniques, it is possible to increase the efficiency of the program.
